Interview test

As an enduser I want to have a small website, which displays various data
of Bundesliga games using the JSON/XML API http://www.openligadb.de/
(see documentation.md).

Provide the following Information:

- Next upcoming matches (following Gameday)
- All matches of the actual season
- Win/Loss Ratio of the actual season of each team

Bonus-Points:

- Automated deployment script with fabric/ansible or the like.
   If you do so, deployment Target should be a local Vagrantbox.

Please describe why you choose which technology (Framework, Language, SOAP/JSON), and provide a description of your Workflow to solve this problem.

A link to a repository with a small Readme.md for setup is needed.

You may use a persistence layer of your choice if you feel the need to
(mongoDB, mySQL p.e)

The actual Design of the Site is totally up to you, functionality and
proper design of the Backend should be your focus. Nice Web-Frontend is a
bonus but not a must.
