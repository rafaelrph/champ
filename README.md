# Why didn't I create a persistence layer?
There is an API where all data is saved and shared. The focus is a simple website which gets, organises and provides relevant information about the leagues, matches, results, etc. This is a simple website so I didn't find any reason to create a persistence layer. 

On a production environment, a persistence layer would have be used to: save and organise differently the data, providing new information; improve the performance of the website, it will reduce the quantity of requests and returned data from API.

# Why did I choose pure JavaScript?
As I said before, this is a small and simple website. I want to bring the same simplicity to the source code. I didn't find any limitation on the features. JavaScript is getting more popular every second. JavaScript's become really powerful... I didn't use to develop in JavaScript, being honest, I have much more experience in Java, PHP, C# (I'm still working with these languages). I've started studying JS this year. I worked with AngularJS in a small project and I got really interested about JS. I've have been studying JS (ES6, TypeScript, Angular2, NodeJS) for months and I wanted to practice all of this knowledge on this project.

I know that on a production enrironment, we have to take care of security, build a more robust architecture, use frameworks, etc... As I said, I just want to show my skills, keep the project simple and well organised.
