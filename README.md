# Why didn't I create a persistence layer?
There is an API where all data is saved and shared. The focus is a simple website which gets, organises and provides relevant information about the leagues, matches, results, etc. This is a simple website so I didn't find any reason to create a persistence layer. However, on a production environment, a persistence layer would have be used to: save and organise differently the data, providing new information; improve the performance of the website, it will reduce the quantity of requests and returned data from API.
